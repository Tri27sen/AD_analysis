# SARIMAX Model for CTR Analysis and Forecasting

## Overview

This README provides an overview of the SARIMAX model applied to analyze and forecast Click-Through Rate (CTR). The SARIMAX model is a time-series forecasting method that incorporates seasonal, trend, and autoregressive components to deliver accurate predictions. The results presented here are based on daily CTR data over one year.
Ads Click-Through Rate (CTR) Analysis and Forecasting: An Overview
CTR is a key performance metric that measures the effectiveness of an advertisement in engaging its target audience. It is calculated as:

CTR
=
(
Clicks
Impressions
)
×
100
CTR=( 
Impressions
Clicks
​
 )×100
CTR analysis and forecasting are crucial for businesses because they provide insights into user behavior, ad performance, and areas for optimization. Here's an in-depth look at the importance and methods for conducting CTR analysis and forecasting.

1. Importance of CTR Analysis
a. Performance Assessment
CTR helps evaluate the effectiveness of ad campaigns:

A high CTR indicates relevant and engaging content.
A low CTR suggests poor targeting, irrelevant content, or a need for design improvement.
b. ROI Optimization
Analyzing CTR in conjunction with Cost Per Click (CPC) and Conversion Rates helps businesses understand the true ROI of their advertising spend.

c. Audience Insights
CTR can reveal:

Which demographics or segments engage more with ads.
The effectiveness of different ad creatives, formats, or platforms.
d. Strategic Planning
By understanding what works and what doesn’t, businesses can:

Refine targeting strategies.
Allocate budgets to high-performing campaigns.
Experiment with ad formats and designs.

## Diagnostics

### **Residual Analysis**

- **Ljung-Box Test (L1):**
  - Q-value: 9.85
  - Prob(Q): 0.00
  - Interpretation: Indicates some residual autocorrelation at lag 1.

### **Normality of Residuals**

- **Jarque-Bera (JB):** 2.16
  - Prob(JB): 0.34
  - Interpretation: Residuals are approximately normally distributed.

### **Heteroskedasticity**

- **H-statistic:** 1.09
  - Prob(H) (two-sided): 0.65
  - Interpretation: Residual variance is stable over time.

## Key Findings

1. **Trend and Seasonality:**
   - The model successfully captures monthly seasonality (“s” = 12) in the CTR data.
2. **Autoregressive and Moving Average Effects:**
   - Significant contributions from AR(1) and MA(1) terms.
3. **Model Fit:**
   - The low AIC and BIC values indicate a good fit.
4. **Forecast Reliability:**
   - Small σ² (sigma²) suggests low variance in the residuals, enhancing prediction accuracy.

---

## Limitations

1. **Ljung-Box Test Result:** Indicates potential autocorrelation in residuals at lag 1.
2. **Confidence Intervals:** The AR.S.L12 coefficient’s confidence interval includes zero, suggesting weaker seasonal autoregression.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Incorporate Exogenous Variables:** Enhance predictions by including external factors such as ad budget, targeting criteria, or platform performance metrics.
- **Model Refinement:** Test alternative seasonal periods (e.g., weekly seasonality).
- **Advanced Techniques:** Compare performance with other models like LSTM or Prophet for forecasting.
